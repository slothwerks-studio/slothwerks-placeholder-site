# SlothWerks LLC
## Placeholder Website

### Why a placeholder website?

Our production time right now is focused on our clients, and the workload is only increasing.  We do not have time to develop a full-fledged site with a portfolio, images, video, and other content.

That said:  the current [SlothWerks website](http://www.slothwerks.com/) was built with Wordpress back in 2013.  It references a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/slothwerks/) that is totally unused and includes legacy products we no longer offer.  Frankly, *anything* would be better than what we have right now.

### Minimum Requirements

We need to at least offer visitors the following:

* A brief explanation as to what SlothWerks is, where it is located, and the services it offers.
* A method to contact SlothWerks (phone, email, et cetera)
* A link to Sloth's [Calendly](https://calendly.com/slothwerks/coffee-meeting/) and [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/slothwerks/).
* A link to SlothWerks on [GitHub](https://github.com/slothwerks-studio).
* A glimpse of the new SlothWerks logo.
* Perhaps a link also to [SlothWerks on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/slothwerks-studio/shared_invite/enQtNTE2MTU0NTkwMDAzLTNkYzhlNGIwMTM2YWU2NWQ0ZWI1MmUxMDFkY2I0NGY3N2EzYmVjNjg2OTlhYmNhZjQwZTBlZDRkMzdiYzQxODQ)?

It would be great to also include the following:

* The ability to view the [Grand Circus Grand Rapids Tech Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=uhj6b9q35gtr5c60ml7utsid80%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).
* The ability to view the [Eastgate Neighborhood Association Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=g0kdapqkqpi4h880u3gnbtg7qg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).
* The ability to play certain recordings from the [SlothWerks audio archives](http://www.slothwerks.com/archives/).

### Tech Stack

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

### Design

Mobile-first, as always.  Since design is not a specialty, we will likely partner with a local designer to assist in the design of the site.

#### Colors

If we use a [color wheel](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/), we can use our logo to create a tetradic palette for the site.

Primary color in logo:  <span style="color: #d46b29">Brown</span>
Associated tetradic colors:  <span style="color: #2976d4">Blue</span>, <span style="color: #ac29d4">Purple</span>, and <span style="color: #d4c029">Maize</span>.
