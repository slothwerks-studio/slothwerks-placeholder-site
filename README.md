# SlothWerks LLC
## Placeholder Website

### Why a placeholder website?

Our production time right now is focused on our clients, and the workload is only increasing.  We do not have time to develop a full-fledged site with a portfolio, images, video, and other content.

That said:  the current [SlothWerks website](http://www.slothwerks.com/) was built with Wordpress back in 2013.  It references a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/slothwerks/) that is totally unused and includes legacy products we no longer offer.  Frankly, *anything* would be better than what we have right now.

### Why build this on GitHub?

This allows us to explore some of the newer options available on GitHub, such as [project boards](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/).  It also will force us to organize our information in a repo [wiki](https://github.com/slothwerks-studio/slothwerks-placeholder-site/wiki) and keep track of updates in [Issues](https://github.com/slothwerks-studio/slothwerks-placeholder-site/issues).

### Is this website online?

Sure.  Check out the live site [here](https://slothwerks-studio.github.io/slothwerks-placeholder-site/).
