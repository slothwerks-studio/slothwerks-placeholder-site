# SlothWerks LLC
## Placeholder Website

A placeholder site for SlothWerks LLC until we develop our actual public-facing site with real content.

Starting out with vanilla JS for the moment.  Theoretically this site will allow visitors to access the Grand Circus tech calendar, the ENA community calendar, and check out the old SlothWerks audio archives.  Maybe even send an email or call.
